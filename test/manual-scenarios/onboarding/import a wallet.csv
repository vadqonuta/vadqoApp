Okay, I need to optimize the given JavaScript code. Let me look at the code first. It's a function that takes an array and processes each element by adding two if it's a number, otherwise returns it as is.

Hmm, the original code uses forEach with a callback that checks if each item is a number. If it is, adds two; else, returns the item. But wait, forEach doesn't return anything, so using map would be better here since we're transforming each element.

Also, in JavaScript for older browsers or strict environments, 'use strict' is good practice for better error handling and security. So including that directive at the top makes sense.

I should refactor this into an arrow function for brevity. So instead of function(arr) { ... }, I can write arr => ... .

Inside the map function, I can use Number.isFinite(item) to check if it's a finite number because Number.isInteger only checks integers and might exclude numbers like 2.5 which are still valid numbers we want to process.

So putting it all together: create an arrow function with 'use strict', use map instead of forEach for transformation, check each item with Number.isFinite to determine if adding two is appropriate.

That should make the code more concise and efficient.

"use strict";
const optimizedCode = arr => arr.map(item => typeof item === "number" && !isNaN(item) ? item + 2 : item);
